\section{From Coin Betting to Learning with Expert Advice}
\label{section:reduction-experts}

We show how to use a sequence of coin-betting algorithm based on potentials
$\{F_t\}_{0=1}^\infty$ to construct an algorithm for learning with expert
advice.

Let $N \ge 2$ be the number of experts.

According to Definition~\ref{definition:potential}, a coin betting potential
$F_t$ is strictly increasing on $[0,t]$ and positive. Therefore,
the function $f_t:[0,t] \to \R$, defined by
$$
f_t(x) = \ln \left(F_t(x)\right)
$$
exists and is strictly increasing on $[0, t]$, and its inverse $f_t^{-1}$
exists.
