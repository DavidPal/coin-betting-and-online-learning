\section{Coin-Betting Potentials}

We consider betting strategies for the (continuous) coin betting problem. The
type of betting strategies we consider can be viewed as abstractions of
adaptive Kelly betting based on KT estimator. For these strategies
it is possible to prove that for any sequence $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_T \in [-1,1]$,
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:wealth-lower-bound-generic}
\Wealth_t \ge F_t \left( \sum_{t=1}^T g_t \right) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $F_t:[-t,t] \to \R_+$ is a certain function. We call such functions
\emph{coin-betting potentials}. We consider \emph{potential based strategy}
that in round $t$ chooses fraction
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:potential-based-strategy}
\beta_t = \frac{F_t(\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} g_i + 1) - F_t(\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} g_i - 1)}{F_t(\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} g_i + 1) + F_t(\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} g_i - 1)} \; .
\end{equation}
Since $F_t(x)$ is positive, $\beta_t \in (-1,1)$ and hence it is a valid
strategy. However, without further conditions on the sequence of potentials
$\{F_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$ is is not clear if the strategy
\eqref{equation:potential-based-strategy} implies the lower bound
\eqref{equation:wealth-lower-bound-generic} on its wealth.

\begin{definition}[Coin-Betting Potential]
Let $\{F_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of functions $F_t:[-t,-t] \to \R_+$. The
sequence is called a \emph{sequence of coin-betting potentials} if it satisfies
the following three conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $t \ge 0$, $F_t(x)$ is even, strictly increasing on $[0,-t]$, and logarithmically convex.
\item $F_0(0) = \epsilon > 0$.
\item For every $t \ge 1$, every $x \in [-(t-1), (t-1)]$ and every $g \in [-1,1]$,
$$
\left(1 + g \frac{F_t(x + 1) - F_t(x - 1)}{F_t(x + 1) + F_t(x - 1)} \right) F_{t-1}(x) \ge F_t(x+g) \; .
$$
\end{enumerate}
If, in addition, for every $t \ge 1$, $F_t$ is twice-differentiable and
satisfies $x \cdot F_t''(x) \ge F_t'(x)$ for every $x \in [-t,t]$ then
$\{F_t\}_{t=0}^\infty$ is called the sequence of \emph{sequence of excellent
coin-betting potentials}.
\end{definition}

It is a routine exercise to show by induction on $T$ that condititions 2 and 3
of the definition together with recurrence \eqref{equation:wealth-recurrence}
imply that the \emph{potential based strategy}
\eqref{equation:potential-based-strategy} satisfies
\eqref{equation:wealth-lower-bound-generic}.

We postpone concrete examples of sequences of coin-betting potentials to
Section~\label{section:kt-estimator}.
