\section{Discussion of the Results and Related Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

The interpretation of parameter-free algorithms as coin-betting algorithms is
new. This interpretation, far from being just a mathematical gimmick, reveals
the common hidden structure of previous parameter-free algorithms. For example,
it is clear now that the characteristic of parameter-freeness is just a
consequence of having an algorithm that guarantees the maximum reward possible.
In this sense, all the online learning algorithm requiring parameter tuning are
just guaranteeing a suboptimal wealth growth. The concept itself of ``learning
rate'' becomes questionable in the light of the presented results. At the same
time, the previous ad-hoc choices of the potentials were just approximations of
the optimal obtainable wealth.

In particular, in previous \ac{LEA} papers the potential used for expert $j$ at
time $t$ is $\exp \left(\frac{([x]_+)^2}{t} \right)$; see
\citep{ChaudhuriYH09,LuoE14,LuoS15}. It is now clear that that potential is just
an approximation of the optimal wealth achievable by a coin-betting algorithm.
Moreover, that potential and the ones in~\citet{ChernovV10,KoolenE15} are not
even, introducing a lot of techical difficulties in the analysis. Instead, our
reduction moves the truncation outside of the potential (see equation
\eqref{eq:gradients_experts_reduction}) making the analysis straightforward.
Also, as observed by \citet{ChernovV10}, our bound in terms of the KL divergence
is superior to the $\epsilon$-quantile bounds.

In the \ac{OLO} setting, \citet{StreeterM12} used a one-dimensional potential of
the form $\exp \left(\frac{|x|}{\sqrt{t}}\right)$, obtaining a suboptimal regret bound.
\citet{Orabona13} extended it to the infinite dimensional case. The optimal
bound has been obtained in \citet{McMahanO14} with potential of the right form:
$\exp \left(\frac{\norm{x}^2}{t}\right)$. Indeed, it is very easy to show that such a
potential is an excellent coin betting potential.

The obtained bounds, in Corollaries~\ref{corollary:kt-hilbert-space-olo-regret}
and~\ref{corollary:kt-experts-regret}, improves the previous ones in terms of
missing $\ln(\ln(T))$ terms and/or in the simplicity of the algorithms.
Moreover, the reductions make possible to transfer any advancement on the
problem of coin-betting to \ac{OLO} and \ac{LEA}. Notice that since the adaptive
Kelly strategy based on \ac{KT} estimator is very close to optimal, the only
possible improvement is to have a data-dependent bound, for example like the
ones in~\cite{KoolenE15}. Indeed, it is very easy to extend the proof of our
reductions to hold in the data-dependent case as well.

Moreover, as already proved in previous papers, the existence of parameter-free
algorithms have broad consequences. For example, \citet{LuoS15} prove that a
parameter-free expert algorithm can be used to to design an efficient algorithm
that predicts as the best pruning tree. In the context of risk minimization over
Lipschitz convex losses in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
\citet{Orabona14} proved that the parameter-free \ac{OLO} can be used to obtain
risk bound guarantees that compete with the regularized \ac{ERM} solution with
oracle tuning of the regularizer. In simpler words, the parameter-free
Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:kt-hilbert-space-olo} can be used to obtain, for
example, the same risk guarantee of a kernel \ac{SVM} with optimal (unknown)
tuning of the regularizer.

Regarding the tightness of the reductions, it is easy to see that they are in a
certain sense optimal. In fact, the obtained
Algorithms~\ref{algorithm:kt-hilbert-space-olo} and~\ref{algorithm:kt-experts}
achieves the optimal worst case upper bound on regret, see \citet{Orabona13} and
\citet{Cesa-BianchiL06} respectively.

It is also possible to have data-dependent bounds, through data-dependent
coin-bettin potentials. For example, it is an easy excercise to show that a
potential of the form $\exp \left(\frac{\norm{x}^2}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}
\|g_{i}\|}\right)$ is an excellent coin betting potential. Through our
reductions, such potential would recover at the same time the bound in
\citet{LuoS15} and \citet{Orabona14}.
