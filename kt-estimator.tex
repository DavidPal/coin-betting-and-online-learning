\section{KT Estimator and Its Applications}
\label{section:kt-estimator}

In this section we show that the potentials associated with Krichevsky-Trofimov
(KT) estimator form a sequence of excellent coin-betting potentials. We then
prove corollaries of the regret bounds for OLO in Hilbert space and learning
with expert advice that we proved in previous sections.
