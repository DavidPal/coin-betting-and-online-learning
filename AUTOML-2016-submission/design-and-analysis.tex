\section{Design and Analysis of Algorithms}

Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:hilbert-space-olo}
is based on the adversarial coin-betting problem.

\textbf{Adversarial Coin Betting.}
Consider a gambler making repeated bets on the outcomes of adversarial coin
flips. The gambler starts with an initial endowment of $1$ dollar. In each
round $t$, he bets on the outcome of a coin flip $g_t \in \{-1,1\}$, where $+1$
denotes heads and $-1$ denotes tails.  The outcome $g_t$ is chosen by an
adversary.  The gambler can bet any amount on either heads or tails. However,
he cannot borrow any additional money. If he loses, he loses the betted amount;
if he wins, he gets the betted amount back and, in addition to that, he gets
the same amount as a reward.  We encode the gambler's bet in round $t$ by a
single number $\beta_t \in [-1,1]$. The sign of $\beta_t$ encodes whether he is
betting on heads or tails. The absolute value encodes the betted amount as the
fraction of his current wealth.  Let $\Wealth_t$ be gambler's wealth at the end
of round $t$. It satisfies
\begin{align}
\label{equation:wealth-recurrence}
\Wealth_0 & = 1 &
& \text{and} &
\Wealth_t & = (1 + g_t \beta_t) \Wealth_{t-1} \qquad \text{for $t \ge 1$} \; .
\end{align}
Note that since $\beta_t \in [-1,1]$, gambler's wealth stays always
non-negative.

\textbf{Kelly Betting and Krichevsky-Trofimov Estimator.}
For sequential betting on i.i.d. coin flips, the optimal strategy has been
proposed by \citet{Kelly-1956}.  The strategy assumes that the coin flips
$\{g_t\}_{t=1}^\infty$, $g_t \in \{+1,-1\}$, are generated i.i.d. with known
probability of heads. If $p \in [0,1]$ is the probability of heads, the Kelly
bet is $\beta_t = 2p - 1$. He showed that, in the long run, this strategy will
provide more wealth than betting any other fixed fraction~\cite{Kelly-1956}.

For adversarial coins, Kelly betting does not make sense.
\citet{Krichevsky-Trofimov-1981} proposed to replace $p$ with an estimate:
After seeing coin flips $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_{t-1}$, use the empirical
estimate $k_t = \frac{1/2 + \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \indicator[g_i = +1]}{t}$. Their
estimate is commonly called \emph{KT estimator}\footnote{Compared to the
standard maximum likelihood estimate $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \indicator[g_i =
+1]}{t-1}$, KT estimator ``shrinks'' slightly towards $\frac{1}{2}$.} and it
results in the betting strategy $\beta_t = 2k_t - 1 = \tfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}
g_i}{t}$.  \citeauthor{Krichevsky-Trofimov-1981} showed that this strategy
guarantees almost the same wealth that one would obtain knowing in advance the
fraction of heads. Namely, 
if we denote by $\Wealth_t(\beta)$ the wealth of the strategy that bets fraction
$\beta$ in every round, then Krichevsky-Trofimov betting strategy ensures
$$
\forall \beta \in [-1,1] \qquad \Wealth_t \ge \frac{\Wealth_t(\beta)}{2\sqrt{t}} \; .
$$
Moreover, this guarantee is optimal up to constant factors~\citep{Cesa-Bianchi-Lugosi-2006}.

\textbf{From betting to \ac{OLO}.}
In Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:hilbert-space-olo}, the ``coin outcome'' is the
vector $g_t \in \H$ and algorithm's wealth is $\Wealth_t = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^t
\langle g_i, w_i \rangle$.  The algorithm explicitly keeps track of its wealth.
and it bets ``vectorial fraction'' $\beta_t = \tfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} g_i}{t}$
of its current wealth. The regret bound
(Theorem~\ref{theorem:hilbert-space-olo-regret}) is a consequence of
Krichevsky-Trofimov lower bound on the wealth and the duality between regret
and wealth.  For more details, see~\cite{Orabona-Pal-2016-parameter-free}.
