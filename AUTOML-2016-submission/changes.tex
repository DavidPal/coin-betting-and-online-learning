\title{Changes to ``Parameter-Free Convex Learning through Coin Betting''}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

We have done the following changes with respect to the original submission of our paper.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reviewer 1: ``Algorithm 3: In the requirements the first sample is expressed as $(X_{1}, Y_{2})$, it should be $(X_{1}, Y_{1})$''\\
\textbf{Fixed.}
\item Reviewer 1: ``Figure 1: The x-axis for all figures is named 'size training set', but the axis represents the learning rate, not the size of the training set (as stated in the caption)''\\
\textbf{Fixed.}
\item Reviewer 1: ``While the inner product is commonly represented as <*,*> when working with hilbert spaces, and should be clearly understood, this is explained in page 2 (end of section 1), but is first used at the beginning of section 1. Could it be possible to move the description of the notations?''\\
\textbf{Fixed, now the notation is defined in the introduction.}
\item Added the accepted NIPS paper as a extended version of this paper.
\item Updated the affiliation of the first author.
\item Changes to the formulas and algorithms (e.g. tfrac has been substituited by frac, more space in the bibliography), to take advantage of the additional space.
\item Fixed typos.
\end{itemize}
